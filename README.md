# ThNeedle
Do you need to check the amount of times you use each word in an essay? Do you fear redundancy? Do you want to have a more diverse array of wording in your essay? As ironic as these questions are, this program is here to let you know how many times you use each word in an essay! It's still in development, so don't get too comfortable yet.

It's just a simple command-line-based function at the moment. You just type the path to the text file you wish to have analyzed and it returns the documents text, the amount of times each word is used above the word used *n* times.

# Example
##### test.txt

`The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog`

*Windows*:

`C:\foo\ ThNeedle test.txt`

*Linux*

`root:~$ ThNeedle test.txt`

##### returns this

```
stuffReturn: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
---------
OUTPUT =| 1 | :
         brown
         jumps
         lazy
OUTPUT =| 2 | :

# Final Thoughts
Do send in any recommendations! This is meant for people who want their *manuscript* to *reflect* an *extensive* vocabulary.
