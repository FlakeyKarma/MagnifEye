    Not every site that claims to have information is as believable as it may seem. The internet is filled with a plethora of groups and individuals who want to disperse ideas, but whether true or not, the true sources also need to be evaluated to understand whether they will build or destroy the main point of the essay. Throughout the research done on my topic the psychological implications of people having imaginary friends as children, but losing them as they age there were numerous documents and sites to choose from, but none of them directly associated. The journey proved to be a ride of piecing together a paper from sources that gave clues towards what imaginary companions may mean to the mind.

    Given that each source was based on a different topic when written, each of them had their own set of information that backed the concept being claimed. But one set of information that was mutually agreed on between each of the sources is that the end of childhood isn’t necessarily the end of having an IC as adults have imaginary friends too. The book did best in explaining what each imaginary friend would be formed as inside the heads of the people with IC’s, from the way they looked to the way they responded to various stimuli. The journal did best at explaining the impact that gender and birth-order had on having an imaginary friend would have. Finally the blog post further explained the presence of IC’s in the lives of people of all ages as well as the healthy effect that it has on each person who is effected. Though the blog post had been written by an experience clinical psychiatrist, and the article was written by educated individuals, neither had as much credibility as the book did. The book, in juxtaposition to the blog and magazine entry, had much more room to explain why everything had occurred as it had and then thoroughly back it up by giving examples explored throughout the research. The book did have a big problem though, it was made back in 1999, meaning it’s not very caught up with modern studies.

Each of the sources had their own positives and negatives, but each also had major contributing points to explain what the implications were of IC’s in the minds of youth. Connecting the pieces gathered from each source, the puzzle presented can be better pulled together. The question regarding which source may have been the best for the essay is out of the question, as the question wouldn’t be completed without the aid of each source. The Frankenstein of an answer can now be put to paper and explained to those who wish to know the answer to the same question or a similar one. Maybe this research can be put to further use by another curious soul and be the foundation for further questions.
